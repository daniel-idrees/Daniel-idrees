### About me:

- I have been developing Android apps since 2013, starting with my first App during my Bachelor's studies, back when it was cool to show off something on your phone and say, “I built this!”
- Over the years, I’ve seen the Android ecosystem evolve significantly. I started with Eclipse as IDE and Java as programming language and have witnessed the transition from Java to Kotlin, RxJava to Coroutines, and XML layouts to Jetpack Compose.
- I have self-learned unit testing and CI/CD processes the hard way, but that experience has shaped me into a more resilient and skilled developer.  
- I am a Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) enthusiast.
- Although Android is my primary focus, I have also dabbled in iOS development. 
- Beyond coding, I am a passionate traveller and know many travelling tips.

- ⚡ Fun fact: In one of my previous jobs, my Team Lead asked me to become the Product Manager for a day. It was a great opportunity to see things from a different perspective and helped me appreciate the importance of bridging the gap between product and development teams.
